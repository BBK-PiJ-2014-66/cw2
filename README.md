Coursework Two
==============

- [Fraction.java](Fraction.java) is tested with [FractionTest.java](FractionTest.java). The 
  (verbose) test output is recorded in the git commit message.
- [FractionCalculator.java](FractionCalculator.java) provides the exercise requirements of an 
   interactive calculator and **evaluate** method. Note that as well as the basic interactive calculator,
    an alternative more advanced calculator can be run, see [README_interactive.asciidoc](README_interactive.asciidoc) for details. 
  - [FractionCalculatorTest.java](FractionCalculatorTest.java) program to test all the classes used
    by [FractionCalculator.java](FractionCalculator.java). 
  - [FracCalcOliver.java](FracCalcOliver.java) (because I mis-read the instruction sheet) this 
    is a provides the code for the alternative "advanced" interactive calculator as well as 
    providing most of the actual functionality for the "basic" calculator and **evaluate** method.
  - [FracCalcOliverTest.java](FracCalcOliverTest.java) tests for the **FracCalcOliver process** method.
    The tests are actually run as part of [FractionCalculatorTest.java](FractionCalculatorTest.java) program.
