Coursework Two
==============

From Programming in Java course http://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/courses/modules/BUCI033S7.php

- The coursework sheet [cw2.pdf](cw2.pdf) 
- [FractionTest.java](FractionTest.java) tests that [Fraction.java](Fraction.java) class works properly. 
  The test output is generally given in the git commit message for each stage of the development. 
- [FractionCalculatorTest.java](FractionCalculatorTest.java) run simple tests on the function of 
  [FractionCalculator.java](FractionCalculator.java) (the tests are actually coded with the latter).
	
  The test output for the tests is recorded in the git commit message of *FractionCalculator.java*.
