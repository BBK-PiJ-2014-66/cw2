Coursework Two
==============

- [Fraction.java](Fraction.java) is tested with [FractionTest.java](FractionTest.java). The 
  (verbose) test output is recorded in the git commit message.
- [FractionCalculator.java](FractionCalculator.java) this provides the interactive calculator to be written
  in the exercise and the required  **evaluate** method. Note that two alternative interactive calculators
  see [README_interactive.html](README_interactive.html) for details. 
  - [FractionCalculatorTest.java](FractionCalculatorTest.java) program to test all the classes used
    by [FractionCalculator.java](FractionCalculator.java). 
  - [FracCalcOliver.java](FracCalcOliver.java) because I mis-read the instruction sheet this 
    is a provides an alternative "advanced" interactive calculator as well as providing most of
    the actual functionality for the "basic" calculat and **evaluate** method.
  - [FracCalcOliverTest.java](FracCalcOliverTest.java) tests for the **FracCalcOliver process** method.
    The tests are actually run as part of [FractionCalculatorTest.java](FractionCalculatorTest.java) program.
